#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1. How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone'
;

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT JanSales.product
,MIN (price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
;

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
, JanSales.Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
;

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT distinct SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
, SUM(quantity)
, FebSales.Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
;

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum)
, AVG(quantity*price)
, FebSales.Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND FebSales.quantity >'2'
;
